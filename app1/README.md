# Retrieval Autmented Generation (RAG) - basic implementation

## Introduction

A basic implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Python involves two main components: a retriever that fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base based on a query, and a generator that uses these retrieved documents as context to generate a response.

Here we are going to implement a basic RAG with simple features.

- Embeds documents and queries
- Retrieves the top-k relevant documents
- Summarize the text

## Setup

```bash
pip install sumy
```

## Running the app

```bash
python app.py
```
